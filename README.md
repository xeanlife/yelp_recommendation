[XGBoost + Catboost](./competition.py)  
[Catboost Regression](./competition_regression.py)  
[Linear Regression](./competition_linear.py)  

## Final Results
**Train RMSE: 0.9722, Validation RMSE: 0.9742, Test RMSE: Ranked #3 out of 300 (RMSE undisclosed).**  
The [final model](./competition.py) was mixed using XGBoost, Catboost, and CF with user friends, then refined with grid-search on many different parameters.
